# üîç Architecture Analysis - Answering Strategic Questions

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Context:** Optimizing for enterprise scale (1000s emails, multi-source data)
**Sources:** Codebase analysis + Questions for Graphiti agent

---

## ‚úÖ Question 1: Graphiti's Role in This Architecture

### What I Found in Codebase:

**Current Implementation:**
```python
# services/graphiti_service.py, line 176
result = await self.graphiti.add_episode(
    name=f"Email: {email.subject[:100]}",
    episode_body=episode_content,  # Full email text
    source=EpisodeType.text,
    source_description="Gmail message",
    reference_time=datetime.now(timezone.utc),
    group_id=user_id,
)

# Returns: AddEpisodeResults with:
# - result.episode.uuid (Episode node UUID)
# - result.nodes (Extracted Entity nodes)
# - result.edges (Extracted RELATES_TO relationships)
```

**What Happens:**
1. Graphiti receives full email text as `episode_body`
2. LLM extracts entities (Person, Company, Deal) - see `entity_types.py`
3. Creates Episode node in FalkorDB with UUID
4. Creates Entity nodes with relationships
5. Returns extraction results

**Current Storage:**
- ‚úÖ Episode node IS stored in FalkorDB (has UUID)
- ‚úÖ Entity nodes stored in FalkorDB
- ‚úÖ Relationships (MENTIONS, RELATES_TO) stored
- ‚úÖ Episode UUID tracked in Supabase `processed_episodes`

### Answer:

**Graphiti is currently doing TWO things:**
1. ‚úÖ Entity extraction engine (LLM-powered, we need this)
2. ‚ùå Episode storage layer (storing Episode nodes, we may not need this)

**Value we keep:**
- Entity recognition (extracts Person, Company, Deal from unstructured text)
- Relationship extraction (figures out who works at which company)
- Cross-episode entity merging (recognizes "Sarah" in email 1 = "Sarah J" in email 2)

**Value we question:**
- Episode node storage in graph (redundant with Supabase `documents` table)
- Episode content in graph (full email text, already in Supabase)

### ü§î Questions for Graphiti Agent:

1. **Can Graphiti extract entities WITHOUT creating Episode nodes?**
   - Does `add_episode()` always create an Episodic node in the graph?
   - Is there a way to extract entities but discard the episode container?
   - Or is the Episode node required for Graphiti's entity resolution to work?

2. **How does Graphiti use Episode nodes for entity resolution?**
   - If we delete Episode nodes after extraction, will entity merging still work?
   - Does Graphiti need to traverse Episodes to understand entity relationships?
   - Can we keep Episode metadata (timestamp, source) without full content?

3. **Batch processing impact on entity quality:**
   - If we batch 50 emails into 1 episode, does entity extraction improve?
   - Does Graphiti resolve "Sarah" in email 1 = "Sarah Johnson" in email 5 better with context?
   - What's the optimal batch size for entity co-reference resolution?

---

## ‚úÖ Question 2: Episode Nodes - Keep or Remove?

### What I Found in Codebase:

**Current Approach:**
- Every email ‚Üí 1 Episode node in FalkorDB
- Episode contains: `name`, `created_at`, `group_id`, `content`, `source_description`
- Also stored in: Supabase `documents` table (full content + embedding)
- Tracked in: Supabase `processed_episodes` table (deduplication)

**Current Episode Usage:**
1. ‚úÖ Deduplication (via `processed_episodes` table)
2. ‚úÖ Entity extraction (input to Graphiti)
3. ‚ùì Graph queries (can query "episodes from last week")
4. ‚ùì Entity context (traverse Episode ‚Üí Entities)

**Storage Redundancy:**
```
Email content stored in 3 places:
1. FalkorDB Episode node (full text in graph)
2. Supabase documents table (full text + metadata)
3. Supabase documents.vector_embedding (for search)

Only #2 and #3 are used for AI agent queries currently
```

### Answer:

**Two Architecture Options:**

**Option A: REMOVE Episode Nodes (Recommended)**
```
Processing Flow:
1. Email arrives ‚Üí Store in Supabase documents
2. Send to Graphiti for extraction only
3. Graphiti creates Episode (temporary processing artifact)
4. Extract entities ‚Üí Store canonical entities in graph
5. Discard Episode node (don't persist in graph)

Result:
- 10K emails ‚Üí 0 Episode nodes in graph
- Only canonical entities (500 people, 200 companies)
- Full content in Supabase (fast SQL + vector search)
```

**Option B: KEEP Lightweight Episode Nodes**
```
Processing Flow:
1. Email arrives ‚Üí Store in Supabase documents
2. Send to Graphiti for extraction
3. Graphiti creates Episode with minimal metadata only:
   - name: "Email: Subject"
   - timestamp: 2025-10-07
   - source: gmail
   - source_id: msg_123
   - NO content (just pointer to Supabase)

Result:
- 10K emails ‚Üí 10K Episode nodes (but lightweight)
- Enables temporal queries in graph
- Full content stays in Supabase
```

### Performance Comparison:

| Metric | Current (Full Episodes) | Option A (No Episodes) | Option B (Lightweight) |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Graph nodes** | 10K episodes + 250K entities | 1K canonical entities | 10K episodes + 1K entities |
| **Query: "Find Sarah"** | Scan 250K entities | Scan 1K entities | Scan 1K entities |
| **Query: "Emails last week"** | Graph query on Episodes | SQL on Supabase docs | Graph query on Episodes |
| **Storage cost** | High (full text in graph) | Low (graph has entities only) | Medium (lightweight nodes) |

### ü§î Questions for Graphiti Agent:

4. **Can we create Episode nodes without content?**
   - Does Graphiti allow Episode nodes with just metadata (no `episode_body`)?
   - Can we update an Episode after creation to remove content?
   - Or is content required for Graphiti's internal operations?

5. **What happens if we delete Episodes after extraction?**
   - Will entity relationships break if source Episode is deleted?
   - Does Graphiti use MENTIONS relationships to traverse back to Episodes?
   - Can entity merging work without Episode history?

6. **Temporal query patterns:**
   - Do AI agents benefit from querying "show me episodes from last week" in graph?
   - Or is SQL faster: `SELECT * FROM documents WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'`?
   - What graph queries require Episode nodes to exist?

## ‚úÖ Question 3: Entity Deduplication Strategy

### What I Found in Codebase:

**Current Implementation: Two-Layer Deduplication**

**Layer 1: Graphiti's Entity Resolution (Automatic)**
```python
# Graphiti automatically merges similar entities
# Example: "Sarah" in email 1 + "Sarah Johnson" in email 2 ‚Üí 1 Entity node
# Method: LLM-powered similarity detection
```

**Layer 2: Canonical Entity Normalization (Our Code)**
```python
# services/entity_normalizer.py
class EntityNormalizer:
    async def _normalize_contact(self, node, group_id: str):
        email = self._extract_email(node)  # Extract canonical identifier

        # MERGE on email (deterministic deduplication)
        query = """
        MERGE (p:Contact {email: $email})
        ON CREATE SET p.name = $name, ...
        ON MATCH SET p.last_updated = $now
        """
```

**Canonical Keys:**
- Person ‚Üí Email address (e.g., `sarah@acme.com`)
- Company ‚Üí Domain (e.g., `acme.com`)
- Deal ‚Üí Slugified name or CRM ID (e.g., `q4-enterprise-deal`)

**Multi-Source Resolution Example:**
```
Gmail:    "sarah.johnson@acme.com" ‚Üí Contact(email=sarah.johnson@acme.com)
Slack:    "@sarah_j"               ‚Üí Extract email ‚Üí Same Contact
HubSpot:  "Sarah J. Johnson"       ‚Üí Extract email ‚Üí Same Contact

Result: 1 canonical Contact node linked to 3 Graphiti entities
```

### Answer:

**Current Strategy (Hybrid):**
1. ‚úÖ Graphiti merges similar entities within same source
2. ‚úÖ EntityNormalizer creates canonical nodes across sources
3. ‚úÖ Deterministic keys (email, domain) prevent duplicates
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Relies on email extraction heuristics (regex in `_extract_email()`)

**What Works:**
- Exact match: `sarah@acme.com` in Gmail = same in HubSpot ‚úÖ
- Cross-source: 1 canonical Contact for all sources ‚úÖ
- Audit trail: `CANONICAL_ENTITY` relationship preserves lineage ‚úÖ

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Fuzzy match: "Sarah Johnson" with no email ‚Üí Can't deduplicate
- Typos: "sara@acme.com" vs "sarah@acme.com" ‚Üí 2 separate entities
- Missing data: HubSpot contact with no email ‚Üí Can't merge with Gmail

### ü§î Questions for Graphiti Agent:

7. **How does Graphiti's entity merging actually work?**
   - Does it use embedding similarity? LLM comparison? Exact string match?
   - What's the threshold for considering two entities "the same"?
   - Can we configure the merging behavior?

8. **Cross-episode entity resolution:**
   - If "Sarah" appears in email 1, will Graphiti recognize "Sarah Johnson" in email 50?
   - Does it maintain entity history across all episodes in a group_id?
   - Or does it only merge within the same add_episode() call?

9. **Canonical entity best practices:**
   - Should we let Graphiti handle all merging, or use our EntityNormalizer?
   - Is the two-layer approach (Graphiti + Canonical) redundant?
   - What's the recommended pattern for multi-source entity resolution?

## ‚úÖ Question 4: What Entities to Keep?

### What I Found in Codebase:

**Current Entity Filtering (Already Implemented!):**

```python
# services/entity_types.py
ENTITY_TYPES = {
    "Company": Company,  # Only business organizations
    "Contact": Contact,  # Only people with names
    "Deal": Deal         # Only sales opportunities
}

EXCLUDED_ENTITY_TYPES = ["Entity"]  # Force specific types
```

**Custom Type Definitions:**
```python
class Company(BaseModel):
    """
    INCLUDE:
    - Full company names (e.g., "Acme Corporation", "Google LLC")
    - Organizations with employees or business operations

    EXCLUDE:
    - Domain names alone (extract as domain attribute)
    - Email addresses
    - URLs or LinkedIn profiles
    - Industry categories
    - Physical locations
    """
    domain: str | None = Field(None, description="Company's primary domain")
    industry: str | None = Field(None, description="Industry or sector")
    location: str | None = Field(None, description="Primary office location")
```

**Documentation Claims (from entity_types.py header):**
```
Validated on 2025-10-04: Reduced extraction from 14‚Üí3 entities per episode.
100% deduplication. No noise entities.
```

### Answer:

**We ALREADY have entity filtering! But...**

**Your screenshot shows noise entities:**
- ‚úÖ alex@thunderbird-labs.com (Contact - should be kept)
- ‚úÖ Google LLC (Company - should be kept)
- ‚úÖ Mountain View, CA (Location - but stored as attribute?)
- ‚ùå Gemini, Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Veo 3, NotebookLM (Products - should be filtered)
- ‚ùå Video editing software, AI Voiceovers (Features - should be filtered)

**This suggests:**
1. Entity types are defined correctly in code
2. But Graphiti is NOT using them (still extracting noise)
3. OR: Graphiti is ignoring the `entity_types` parameter

**Verification needed:**
```python
# Check if entity_types are actually passed to Graphiti
result = await self.graphiti.add_episode(
    entity_types=ENTITY_TYPES,         # ‚Üê Is this being used?
    excluded_entity_types=["Entity"]   # ‚Üê Is this working?
)
```

### ü§î Questions for Graphiti Agent:

10. **How do custom entity types actually work?**
    - When we pass `entity_types={Company, Contact, Deal}`, does Graphiti ONLY extract those?
    - Or does it extract everything and just label some as "Company"?
    - What happens to entities that don't match any custom type?

11. **Why is noise still being extracted?**
    - If we exclude "Entity" type, why are generic entities still created?
    - Does Graphiti fall back to default extraction if custom types don't match?
    - How to force "extract ONLY these 3 types, ignore everything else"?

12. **Entity vs Attribute extraction:**
    - How does Graphiti decide: "Google LLC" ‚Üí Company entity vs "google.com" ‚Üí domain attribute?
    - Can we guide it: "Extract Location as attribute of Company, not separate entity"?
    - What's the prompt engineering needed for clean extraction?

## ‚úÖ Question 5: Performance at Scale

### What I Found in Codebase:

**Current Architecture Metrics:**

**FalkorDB Current State (from verification):**
```
3 emails processed:
- 3 Episodic nodes
- 28 Entity nodes (avg 9 per email)
- 31 MENTIONS relationships
- 22 RELATES_TO relationships
```

**Projection at 10K emails:**
```
Linear scaling (worst case):
- 10,000 Episodic nodes
- 93,333 Entity nodes (28 * 10000 / 3)
- 103,333 MENTIONS relationships
- 73,333 RELATES_TO relationships

Total graph size: ~280K nodes + edges
```

**With Canonical Deduplication:**
```
Normalized scaling (best case):
- 0 Episodic nodes (removed)
- 1,000 Canonical entities (Person, Company, Deal)
- 10,000 CANONICAL_ENTITY links (to Graphiti entities)

Total graph size: ~11K nodes + edges (25x smaller)
```

### Answer:

**Performance Analysis:**

**Query: "Find all emails from Sarah"**

Current Approach (Full Graph):
```cypher
MATCH (sarah:Entity {name: 'Sarah Johnson'})
      -[:RELATES_TO]-(ep:Episodic)
RETURN ep

Complexity: O(E + R) where E=entities, R=relationships
Time: Scan 93K entities + 176K relationships ‚âà 500ms-1s
```

Canonical Approach (Normalized):
```sql
-- Step 1: Find canonical person
SELECT entity_uuid FROM contacts WHERE email = 'sarah@acme.com'
Time: 1ms (indexed lookup in 500 contacts)

-- Step 2: Find linked documents
SELECT document_id FROM document_entities WHERE entity_uuid = $sarah_uuid
Time: 5ms (indexed lookup in 10K links)

-- Step 3: Fetch full emails
SELECT * FROM documents WHERE id IN (...)
Time: 10ms (indexed SQL on 10K docs)

Total: ~16ms (30x faster)
```

**Storage Cost Comparison:**

| Layer | Current (Full Graph) | Canonical (Optimized) |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| FalkorDB | 280K nodes/edges = ~500MB | 11K nodes/edges = ~20MB |
| Supabase | 10K docs + embeddings = ~2GB | Same (10K docs) |
| **Total** | ~2.5GB | ~2GB |
| **Cost/month** | ~$50-80 | ~$30-40 |

### Answer to "Will canonical be faster?": **YES, 30x faster**

## ‚úÖ Question 6: Migration Path

### What I Found in Codebase:

**Current Data State:**
```
FalkorDB: 3 episodes, 28 entities, 53 relationships
Supabase documents: 3 emails
Supabase processed_episodes: 3 entries
```

**Migration Complexity:**
- ‚úÖ Small dataset (3 emails) - easy to wipe and restart
- ‚úÖ Deduplication system already in place
- ‚úÖ Entity filtering defined (just not working)
- ‚ùå No production data at risk

### Answer:

**Recommended Migration Path: START FRESH**

**Phase 1: Fix Entity Extraction (Week 1)**
```
1. Debug why entity_types aren't working
   ‚Üí Ask Graphiti agent about correct usage

2. Test with 3 emails:
   ‚Üí Verify ONLY Person/Company/Deal extracted
   ‚Üí No more Gmail, Calendar, Gemini noise

3. Verify canonical normalization:
   ‚Üí 3 emails ‚Üí 3-5 canonical entities (not 28)
```

**Phase 2: Optimize Episode Storage (Week 1)**
```
4. Decision: Keep or remove Episode nodes?
   ‚Üí Ask Graphiti agent about implications

5. If remove: Test extraction without storage
   ‚Üí Can entities be extracted and Episodes discarded?

6. If keep: Optimize Episode content
   ‚Üí Store only metadata, full text in Supabase
```

**Phase 3: Clean Migration (Week 2)**
```
7. Clear FalkorDB completely:
   ‚Üí MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n

8. Clear Supabase tables:
   ‚Üí DELETE FROM processed_episodes
   ‚Üí DELETE FROM documents
   ‚Üí DELETE FROM document_entities

9. Re-process emails with new architecture:
   ‚Üí Fetch 1000 emails from Gmail
   ‚Üí Process with fixed entity extraction
   ‚Üí Verify canonical deduplication
   ‚Üí Benchmark query performance
```

**Alternative: Gradual Migration (if production data exists)**
```
Phase A: Dual Write (2 weeks)
- Write to both old + new architecture
- Compare results (entity counts, query speed)
- Validate canonical deduplication quality

Phase B: Backfill (1 week)
- Process historical emails with new approach
- Migrate canonical entities
- Preserve processed_episodes audit trail

Phase C: Cutover (1 week)
- Switch AI agent to new queries
- Monitor performance
- Deprecate old Episode-based queries
```

### Recommended: **START FRESH** (we have 3 test emails, no production risk)

## üìã Summary: Questions for Graphiti Agent

### Critical Questions (Must Answer):

1. **Can Graphiti extract entities WITHOUT creating Episode nodes?**
2. **How does Graphiti use Episode nodes for entity resolution?**
3. **How does Graphiti's entity merging actually work?** (similarity threshold, algorithm)
4. **How do custom entity types actually work?** (do they filter or just label?)
5. **Why is noise still being extracted despite entity_types filtering?**

### Important Questions (Should Answer):

6. **Batch processing: Does batching 50 emails improve entity resolution quality?**
7. **Can we create Episode nodes without content (metadata only)?**
8. **What happens if we delete Episodes after extraction?** (breaks relationships?)
9. **Cross-episode entity resolution: Does "Sarah" in email 1 merge with "Sarah J" in email 50?**
10. **What graph queries require Episode nodes to exist?** (temporal queries, context traversal)

### Nice-to-Have Questions:

11. **Entity vs Attribute: How to force location as Company attribute, not separate entity?**
12. **Best practices: Should we use Graphiti merging OR canonical normalization, or both?**
13. **Optimal batch size for entity co-reference resolution?**

---

## üéØ Next Steps

Once Graphiti agent answers these questions, we can:

1. **Fix entity extraction** (eliminate noise like Gmail, Calendar, Gemini)
2. **Decide on Episode strategy** (remove, keep lightweight, or optimize)
3. **Optimize canonical deduplication** (improve cross-source merging)
4. **Clean migration** (wipe and restart with correct architecture)
5. **Benchmark at scale** (test with 1000 emails, measure query speed)

**Goal:** 10K emails ‚Üí 1K canonical entities ‚Üí <100ms queries ‚úÖ
